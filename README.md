# Flag game

Flag game is a game created using html, css and javaScript. Upon pressing the start button you have two parts to the game to complete it and receive your final score. Part one consists of 5 questions one after the other where the a random country and a random flag appear and the user is required to choose true or false in order to go to the next question.
Part two is very similar but instead of a country as an option the capital city of the country is required. Upon the user answering 5 questions of each part his/her final score appears along with a play again button.
